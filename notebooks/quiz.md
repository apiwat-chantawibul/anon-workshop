Here are [10 MISUNDERSTANDINGS RELATED TO ANONYMISATION](https://www.edps.europa.eu/system/files/2021-04/21-04-27_aepd-edps_anonymisation_en_5.pdf).

Let's test our understanding by pointing out what's wrong with each statement.
The solution is in the original document.

1. "Pseudonymisation is the same as anonymisation"
2. "Encryption is anonymisation"
3. "Anonymisation of data is always possible"
4. "Anonymisation is forever"
5. "Anonymisation always reduces the probability of re-identification of a dataset to zero"
6. "Anonymisation is a binary concept that cannot be measured"
7. "Anonymisation can be fully automated"
8. "Anonymisation makes the data useless"
9. "Following an anonymisation process that others used successfully will lead our organisation to equivalent results"
10. "There is no risk and no interest in finding out to whom this data refers to"
